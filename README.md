# Chris here,
There is a quote that says, “ It’s never too late for new beginnings in your life ”. Many people assume that skill development is an ‘age sensitive’ thing and can only apply to people who are just starting their career. Whether you are 11 or 85 there is no reason why you can’t start now. Age is simply a number.
